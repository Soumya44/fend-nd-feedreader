# Project Overview

In this project, We will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


##  How to Run Appilcation

* Download repositrory from <a href="https://github.com/Soumya44/fend-nd-feedreader.git">here.</a>
* Then open the ```index.html``` file in a browser.
* You can locate the test results at the bottom of the landing page.

##  Tests That Were Implemented

* Tests for allfeeds has been defined and that it is not empty 
* Tests for allFeeds have a valid url
* Tests for allFeeds have a non-empty name 
* Searches for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks that the menu is hidden
* Toggles on click event if the menu appears or disappears
* Tests if the loadFeed function has at least a single '.entry' within the '.feed' container
* Tests to see if two entries are equal or not
